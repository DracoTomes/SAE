## About
This is a website project for an online D&D character sheet manager. I'm making this for a school assignment.

This is made using Flask so it runs a local webserver. You can connect on http://localhost:5000 or http://127.0.0.1:5000

## Installation

PSA: I don't know how to create actual python applications so here's the deal:
* Run **setup.bat** first. *It creates a venv and installs the requirements into it.*
* Run **run.bat**. *This activates the venv, runs run.py and starts the webserver.*

You can of course do this by hand and need to if you don't run Windows.
